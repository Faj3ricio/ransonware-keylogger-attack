# Malware Simulation Study Project

⚠️ **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY** ⚠️

This repository contains Python-based simulations of malware behavior for educational and research purposes only. The code examples demonstrate how malware works to help understand cyber security threats and develop better defense mechanisms.

## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

This project is created **STRICTLY** for educational purposes. The code and information provided here must:
- NEVER be used for malicious purposes
- ONLY be used in controlled, isolated test environments
- NOT be modified or deployed for harmful activities

Malicious use of this code may be illegal and subject to criminal prosecution.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This project aims to:
1. Demonstrate and understand malware behavior in a controlled environment
2. Learn about cybersecurity threats and defense mechanisms
3. Practice Python programming skills
4. Study encryption/decryption techniques
5. Understand data protection and security best practices
